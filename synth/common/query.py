"""measure: Make measurements on an event log.

    Scan an event log and make measurements on it.
    This module is intended to (eventually) be a functional equivalent
    to DevicePilot's query() endpoint, and thus able to regression-test it.

    This module can also be run on the command-line as a standalone utility, with input filename and other arguments.
